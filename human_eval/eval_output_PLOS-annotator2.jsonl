Culex quinquefasciatus collected in Uganda, where no vector control interventions directly targeting this species have been conducted, was used as a model to determine if it is possible to detect heterogeneities in selection pressure exerted by insecticidal application targeting other insect species. Microsatellite markers were assessed by genotyping two target-site mutations, Vgsc-1014F of pyrethroid and DDT insecticides, and Ace1-119S of the acetylcholinesterase gene, target of carbamate and organophosphate insectsicides. In the central region, a frequency of 62% and 32% for the resistant allele were observed, respectively, whereas in both Eastern and Southwestern regions the Ace-1 allele frequency was close to fixation ( although frequencies may be", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "3", "Layness": "1", "Factuality": "3"}}
