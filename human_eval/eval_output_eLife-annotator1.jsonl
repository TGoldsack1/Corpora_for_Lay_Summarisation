This process, known as epigenetics, involves chemical modifications to DNA that turn genes on or off. For example, DNA methyl groups can be added to or removed from certain proteins, which can alter gene activity. Epigenetics can control what goes on in a cell by altering how DNA is packaged in the cell. It is still unclear how microbes secrete effector proteins that activate their host\u2019s defenses, but previous research has shown that similar effectors secreted from the fungus Phytophthora sojae could affect the genes of soybean plants. Now, Saavedra et al. reveal that a protein released from this parasite, called PsAvh52, causes plants to produce full virulence and lower levels of histone modifications, making the plants more vulnerable to P. so jia. To confirm the role of this protein in regulating gene expression, the researchers made use of biochemical approaches and examined what happened to other proteins when Ps Avh42 was released. Sequencing the genomes of the infected plants revealed that GmTAP1 is an enzyme that can add chemical groups to histones, and that this allowed the protein to become part of a larger class of epigenetic modifications that made the crop more able to infect its host. From this, these findings reveal new ways that microbes can manipulate plant immunity. They also show that host cells could create their own proteins to amplify the impact of chemical marks on defense genes, while leaving susceptible cells unharmed. Together these new findings could help to improve our understanding of how microbial infections cause disease and increase resistance to crop diseases.", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "3", "Layness": "2", "Factuality": "2"}}

The TRim5 proteins are made up of several smaller building blocks, each of which consists of a hexagonal ring of three domains.

However, this approach does not work for all retroviruses, as it requires that the entire protein chain is assembled into a ring. Now, Rustagi, Pertel et al. have developed new methods to identify and purify the transient transporters that form part of this chain. This approach revealed that these channels are highly ordered and that their flexibility is critical for the protein to recognize and destroy damage. In addition, because the size of each domain is crucial for recognizing a retrovirus and for generating the correct responses to subsequent infection, the flexibility must be maintained. Further experiments showed that, in primates, several of their TRIm5 domains are arranged in a pattern of hexagons, rather than round spheres like in the human genome. These findings contribute to our view that our ability to fight viral infections is due, at least in part, to an assembly of very large rings of RNA molecules within the cell surface membrane.

Studying the role of sleep in early brain development in animals may help us learn more. Fruit flies are often used in experiments as models for studying how animals develop. There are, however, no tools that can allow researchers to examine larval sleep while larvae sleep. Until now, these tools have only been used with larvae of adult animals. Hsu et al. have now developed a new system in which sleep-deprived fruit fly larvae can be monitored for hours under night. This system made it possible to monitor activity in the larvae for longer periods of time. The larvae were fed a diet that contained different amounts of a chemical called octopamine, which resembles mammalian norepinephrine ( also known as dopamine ), while their behavior was monitored using an automated imaging system. As the two stages progressed, more and more neural stem cells were generated, suggesting that sleep is required for the larva to grow its brain. Further experiments revealed that adult flies were more likely to lose sleep than larvae that were sleep deprived. In addition, genetic studies in fruit flies show that reducing the sleep of young larvae disrupts the formation of brain networks. So, this system may be useful for understanding how adult brains develop and for designing new brain treatments.", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "4", "Layness": "4", "Factuality": "2"}}

To fit this DNA inside the cell nucleus, proteins modify the histone proteins so that it is easier for the DNA to fit inside, and also to unpick ( or be \u2018expressed\u2019 ). This allows the genes in the nucleus to be expressed as proteins. A group of proteins called the MLL complex helps to keep the genome compacted by binding to specific portions of DNA called histones. Histones also contain chemical tags that regulate the activity of other protein complexes. One protein in particular, called WDR5, is required for embryonic stem cells to continue to self- renew when certain genes are switched on. The role of this protein complex is unclear. However, some lncRNAs ( short for long non-coding RNAs ) are known to bind directly to the protein chain, but the relationship between these two activities remains poorly understood. Now Migliori et al. have found that a mutant form of a protein, which is called F266A, can counteract the effects of the mutant protein. Further experiments revealed that specific RNA molecules can bind to a site that is also found in DNA from a mouse called ESC. In human cells that lack a gene for ETS, the expression of genes that are normally switched off is defective, as is the case for many other types of cancer. Furthermore, specific transcripts had been shown to play important roles in maintaining the integrity of chromosomes as cells differentiate into more complex cells, instead of being used as templates for making DNA or as a building block for other proteins or molecules.

In other words, the evolutionary forces that act to reduce the spread of transpsons were largely non-deterministic.

One of the key players in this process is a protein called Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ), which is found in a small area at the base of a nearby stem called the limb bud. In humans, mutations in the gene that encodes the SHh gene are associated with three diseases that result in lost limbs, such as Werner's syndrome. At the start of each limb Bud, the cells at opposite ends of both limbs are organised into a structure called a \u201czone of polarizing activity\u201d. The ZRS is only active at this point and the level of expression that regulates its activity is not well understood. Furthermore, it is poorly understood how nerve cells control the position of this position. To address these questions, Furniss, Watkins et al. investigated how a chemical messenger called fibroblast growth factor stimulates the production of Zh. Experiments with mouse embryos revealed that another protein, ETV4, plays an important role in establishing the zone of polarization activity. Together with another molecule called GABP\u03b1, FGF establishes a site where a gene is inactive in cells that receive the signal from the hair-like structures at its base. However, an enzyme called HDAC2 removes chemical markers that are needed to switch off the ZH gene and so keeps the DNA in its inactive state. Further experiments found that EEV4 and GAP\u03b1 are able to reach this site by interacting with a histone protein that has been modified to prevent it from being switched on. Thus, in mice that lack E3, cells position the zRS gene so that its expression is more controlled than in normal mice. Future studies will focus on learning how this DNA region switches on genes to give rise to the limbs of", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "3", "Layness": "4", "Factuality": "3"}}

The idea that the hippocampal brain is made up of an extensive network of different cells, is supported by evidence from hundreds of research papers. However, relatively little is known about the nature of these interactions and how they relate to memory. This makes it difficult to understand what role the particular neuron types play in the hippocampus. Two decades after the advent of the neuron doctrine, researchers have made great progress in understanding how neurons are organized and distributed in neuroscience. But the current approach of neuron classification\u2014which is called \u2018minimalization\u2019\u2014is still incomplete. Many experiments in mice have investigated the properties of neurons, but these experiments have often been incomplete because they often do not provide the detailed information needed to build a robust picture of what each neuron type does. Here, Hastings et al. set out to challenge this limitation by employing a large-scale literature mining effort to find all the neurons that are known to be involved in hippocampin formation. In the process, the data were extracted from almost 14, 000 papers and then decoded to form a more detailed model ofocampal architecture and activity. Analysing the published data revealed the remarkable number of connections between the cell types, including axons and dendrites, that can be reconciled and compared to try to extract the most useful information. Hastings and co-workers used their method to identify 122 different neurons across the corpus callosum ( the dense band of nerve fibers that carries information between neurons ) and describe the activity patterns of each cell type. They also used the Hippocampome website to make a series of user-friendly and online searches, which can encourage researchers to interact with their data and to explore their findings in a broad range of contexts.", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "5", "Layness": "5", "Factuality": "4"}}

Drugs that bind to these proteins could potentially help to treat conditions that cause tissues to grow incorrectly, such as arthritis and osteoarthritis. A type of collagen called the discoidin domain receptor 1 is also important for the growth and progression of bone and many other diseases. Like all proteins, DDR2 is made up of a chain of subunits that includes a \u2018transporter\u2019 domain that spans the inside of the receptor and is required for its activity. However, it was not clear how this works. To address this question, Leitinger et al. generated a number of genetically engineered mice that each had a defective version ( which mimics the human form of DDR ) and that lacked the reporter domain. These mice were then exposed to collagen on several different occasions. The most important of these was the collagen-binding domain, which forms a mesh-like network that helps cells to adhere to each other and to move within tissues. In many diseases, the DDR-receptor pairs have an abnormal shape and can only be activated by stimulating the phosphorylation ( in other words, they have a receptor that can bind a collagen ) of their receptor subtypes. Thus, through a mechanism that never goes awry, these receptor mutants can maintain their ability to bind collagen in this way. Further experiments showed that this behaviour only occurs if the two DDR subcompetent receptors have identical structures, implying that the initiator domain plays a crucial role in growing the cancerous tissue found in mammals. For the future to test this hypothesis, a detailed understanding of how these parasites recruit their kinase partners to the membrane of diseased cells will be essential for developing new therapies.", "scores": {"Comprehensiveness": "3", "Layness": "2", "Factuality": "4"}}
